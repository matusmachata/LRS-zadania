CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/lrs-ubuntu/Documents/GitHub/LRS-zadania/workspace/build/template_drone_control/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/lrs-ubuntu/LRS_workspace/build/template_drone_control where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/lrs-ubuntu/Documents/GitHub/LRS-zadania/workspace/src/template_drone_control/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/lrs-ubuntu/LRS_workspace/src/template_drone_control/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
