# BFS - Flood Fill

A short practical example of BFS algorithm using flood fill. 

To run the example:
```
cd bfs_ff
python bfs.py
```

If you investigate the implmenetation please see that `map_080.pgm` will be used for planning. Path will be planned from starting position (250, 300) and target position (50, 35). The path will be printed in the console and the visualization is available in the `path_output.pgm`.
